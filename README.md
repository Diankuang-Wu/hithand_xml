# hithand_xml
The hithand_to_mujoco.xml file is compiled from hithand_to_mujoco.urdf by myself, 
and hithand_to_mujoco.urdf is changed from hithand_ros/hithand_description/urdf/hithand.urdf.
hithand_ros is from https://github.com/Qianboy/hithand_ros
Also, this xml file is not better yet, when you run it in mujoco, the joint state is variable all the timeï¼ŒI will fix it soon.
