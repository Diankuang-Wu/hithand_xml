# hithand_xml
The hithand_to_mujoco.xml file is compiled from hithand_to_mujoco.urdf by mujoco ./compile, 

and hithand_to_mujoco.urdf is changed by myself from hithand_ros/hithand_description/urdf/hithand.urdf.

hithand_ros is from https://github.com/Qianboy/hithand_ros

Also, this xml file is not better yet, when you run it in mujoco, the joint state is variable all the timeï¼ŒI will try to fix it.
